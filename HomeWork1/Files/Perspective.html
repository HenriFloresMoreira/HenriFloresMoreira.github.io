<h1>Changing Perspective</h1>
<p>
Before be able to change perspective in Eclipse we must first know if the version of eclipse has the Web Perspective<br>
If it does you may skip to Step 6 in Perspective. <br>
If it does not you may follow these steps to get on the right path.
</p>

<p>
Step 1: To get the Web Perspective we must download it through Eclipse. At the top of Eclipse the Help drop down menu has the option to install new software. This is where we will download it.
