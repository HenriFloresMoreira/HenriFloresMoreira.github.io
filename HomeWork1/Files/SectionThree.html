<h1>State Space Planning Using Transaction Logic</h1>
<blockquote>
State space planning algorithms have been considered as one of the main classical planning techniques to solve classical planning problems since 1960.
In this paper, we show that Transaction Logic is an appropriate language and framework to study and compare these planning algorithms, which enables one to have more efficient planners in logic programming frameworks. 
Specifically, we take STRIPSSTRIPS planning and forward state space planning algorithms, and show that the specification of these algorithms in Transaction Logic lets one implement complicated planning algorithms in declarative programming languages (e.g. Prolog). 
We first provide a formal representation of these planning algorithms in Transaction Logic, which can be used to automatically translate STRIPSSTRIPS planning problems in PDDL to Transaction Logic rules. 
Then, we use the resulting Transaction Logic rules to solve planning problems and compare the performance of those algorithms in our simple interpreter implemented in XSB Prolog. 
We use several case studies to show how the linear STRIPSSTRIPS planning algorithm is faster than forward state space search. 
Our experiments highlight the fact that a planner implemented by logic programming framework can become faster if an appropriate planning algorithm is applied.

<h1>Planning with Regression Analysis in Transaction Logic</h1>
<blockquote>
Heuristic search is arguably the most successful paradigm in Automated Planning, which greatly improves the performance of planning strategies. However, adding heuristics usually leads to very complicated planning algorithms. 
In order to study different properties (e.g. completeness) of those complicated planning algorithms, it is important to use an appropriate formal language and framework. 
In this paper, we argue that Transaction Logic is just such a specification language, which lets one formally specify both the heuristics, the planning algorithm, and also facilitates the discovery of more general and more efficient algorithms. 
To illustrate, we take the well-known regression analysis mechanism and show that Transaction Logic lets one specify the concept of regression analysis easily and thus express RSTRIPSRSTRIPS, a classical and very complicated planning algorithm based on regression analysis. 
Moreover, we show that extensions to that algorithm that allow indirect effects and action ramification are obtained almost for free. Finally, a compact and clear logical formulation of the algorithm lets us prove the completeness of RSTRIPSRSTRIPS-a result that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been known before.

<h1>Planning with Transaction Logic</h1>
<blockquote>
Automated planning has been the subject of intensive research and is at the core of several areas of AI, including intelligent agents and robotics. 
In this paper, we argue that Transaction Logic is a natural specification language for planning algorithms, which enables one to see further afield and thus discover better and more general solutions than using one-of-a-kind formalisms. 
Specifically, we take the well-known STRIPSSTRIPS planning strategy and show that Transaction Logic lets one specify the STRIPSSTRIPS planning algorithm easily and concisely, and to prove its completeness. 
Moreover, extensions to allow indirect effects and to support action ramifications come almost for free. Finally, the compact and clear logical formulation of the algorithm made possible by this logic is conducive to fruitful experimentation. 
To illustrate this, we show that a rather simple modification of the STRIPSSTRIPS planning strategy is also complete and yields speedups of orders of magnitude.

<h1>Solving Sequential Planning Problems via Constraint Satisfaction</h1>
<blockquote>
Planning problems deal with finding a sequence of actions that transfer the initial state of the world into a desired state. 
Frequently such problems are solved by dedicated algorithms but there exist planners based on translating the planning problem into a different formalism such as constraint satisfaction or Boolean satisfiability and using a general solver for this formalism. 
The paper describes how to enhance existing constraintmodels of sequential planning problems by using techniques such as symmetry breaking (dominance rules), singleton consistency, nogoods, lifting, or techniques motivated by the partial-order planning.

<h1>A Deductive Solution for Plan Generation</h1>
<blockquote>
A new deductive method for solving robot problems is presented in this paper. 
The descriptions of initial and goal situations are given by logical formulas. 
The primitive actions are described by rules, i.e. logical formulas as well. 
Altogether this results in a problem description as in logic programming or in program synthesis. 
A solution is generated by a proof of this description as in program synthesis, except that here proofs have to be strictly linear. 
This restriction is the clue to our solution; it can be easily added as an option to any theorem prover such as one based on the connection method used hereafter. 
In fact this restriction speeds up the proof search considerably. 
At the same time our approach offers an elegant solution of the frame problem.
