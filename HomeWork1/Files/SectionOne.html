<h1>Ecuador's Earthquake</h1>
<blockquote>
The death toll from Ecuador's magnitude-7.8 earthquake climbed to 654 Saturday evening, according to the country's Risk Management Office.
The agency also reported that 58 people remain missing since the April 16 quake and 12,492 are injured. It also announced that almost 26,091 people remain in shelters.
Most of the deaths came from three towns in coastal Ecuador: Manta, Portoviejo and Pedernales, according to statistics provided by the office.
In an effort to boost reconstruction efforts, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa announced a series of financial measures, including a tax increase, on prime time television.
"Rebuilding the affected areas will take years and cost millions of dollars," he said. "The short term costs are significant."
He announced a raft of short-term and one-time tax measures, including a sales tax increase for one year. He also said that the government will sell some of its assets.

<h1>Nepal's Earthquake</h1>
<blockquote>
The death toll from Nepal's April 25 earthquake now stands at 8,019, the country's National Emergency Operations Center said Sunday.
Also, 17,866 people were injured and 366 are still missing, the center said.
It's been more than two weeks since the magnitude-7.8 earthquake rocked Nepal, and the death toll continues to rise.
Tremors from aftershocks were still being felt as recently as Friday, when a magnitude-4.7 temblor struck south of Kodari, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
As aid flows in from around the world, officials are trying to get a handle on the scope of the damage. At last count Thursday, the National Emergency Operations Center estimated that more than 10% of the country's homes were destroyed (299,588) or damaged (269,107).
